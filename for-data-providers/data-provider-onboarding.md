# Data Provider Onboarding

Become a verified data provider on Opendatabay and start listing your datasets. The process takes 15-20 minutes to complete, with 1-2 business days for verification.

## Onboarding Steps

### 1. Create Your Account

**Register at [Opendatabay](https://www.opendatabay.com)**

**Recommended:** Use your **company domain email** (e.g., name@yourcompany.com)

While Google and GitHub login options are available, company email ensures faster verification and establishes business credibility.
