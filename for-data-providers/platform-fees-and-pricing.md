# Platform Fees and Pricing

## Transaction Fees and Charges

Opendatabay applies a **tiered commission structure** on all **dataset sales, API calls, and data access fees**. The commission decreases as the transaction value increases, ensuring better rates for higher-value sales. After deducting the platform fee, the remaining balance is paid out to the Data Provider.

**Please note**:  
- Opendatabay does **not charge any upfront listing fees**. Fees are applied **only on completed transactions**.  
- All fees are calculated per individual dataset, API call, or access transaction, **not cumulatively**.
