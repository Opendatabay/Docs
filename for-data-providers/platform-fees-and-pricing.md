# Platform Fees and Pricing

## Listing Fees and Charges

Opendatabay applies a **tiered commission structure** on all dataset sales, API calls, and data access fees. The commission decreases as the transaction value increases, ensuring better rates for higher-value sales. After deducting the platform fee, the remaining balance is paid out to the Data Provider.

**Please note**: All fees are based on individual dataset prices and not on monthly or cumulative sales.
