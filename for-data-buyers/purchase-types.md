# Purchase Types

Opendatabay enables flexible purchasing options, ***defined by data providers***, to meet diverse data needs.
## Available Purchase Types

### 1. One-Time Purchase

Pay once to access a specific dataset, ideal for users who need immediate access without ongoing costs.

**Best for:**
- Single project requirements
- Historical data analysis
- One-off research needs
- Budget-conscious purchases

### 2. Subscription

Pay a recurring fee (monthly or annually) for continuous access to datasets, suitable for users who require regular updates and ongoing access.

**Best for:**
- Regularly updated datasets
- Ongoing business intelligence
- Long-term research projects
- Teams needing consistent data access

### 3. Pay-Per-Use

Pay based on the amount of data accessed or the number of API calls made, perfect for users who need flexible access without a long-term commitment. Usually these API calls are direct with the data provider.

**Best for:**
- Variable usage patterns
- Testing and experimentation
- Scalable data consumption
- Cost-efficient access for occasional use

### 4. Data Reports

Customized data reports tailored to specific requirements, where pricing is determined per report, ideal for users seeking in-depth, specialized insights without the need to purchase raw data.

**Best for:**
- Executive summaries and insights
- Custom analysis and visualizations
- Market research reports
- Specialized industry intelligence

### 5. Managed Access

Continuous access to datasets stored on cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Snowflake, with subscription-based or one-time payment models. This option is ideal for businesses and analysts who need consistent and extensive data access for ongoing projects. This could also apply where access is given to data dashboards and platforms.

**Best for:**
- Enterprise data integration
- Cloud-native architectures
- Large-scale data operations
- Dashboard and platform access

### 6. Data Licenses

Some datasets may be available under specific licenses (e.g., General AI Training and Fine-tuning Data License, Commercial AI Training and Fine-tuning Data License) that dictate the terms of use and access, which can be purchased based on the licensing agreement.

**Best for:**
- AI model training and fine-tuning
- Machine learning development
- Commercial AI applications
- Research and academic projects
