#### AI-Powered Query Search

**How it works:**

## Understanding Accuracy Scores

Each search result includes an **accuracy score** indicating how well the dataset matches your requirements:

| Score Range | What It Means |
|-------------|---------------|
| **90-100%** | Excellent match - highly recommended for your needs |
| **75-89%** | Good match - likely suitable with minor considerations |
| **60-74%** | Moderate match - review carefully to ensure fit |
| **Below 60%** | Lower match - may not fully meet your requirements |

**Example:**
- Query: "I need sentiment analysis training data"
- Result A: 95% accuracy score → Best fit for your project
- Result B: 54% accuracy score → May not be optimal for sentiment analysis
