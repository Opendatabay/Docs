# How Opendatabay Works

Opendatabay is the **AI Training Data Exchange** connecting data providers with AI developers, reducing data acquisition from weeks to seconds.

## The Purpose

**We solve the AI data supply problem.**

AI developers waste 40-60% of project time sourcing, cleaning, and licensing training data. The end of free scraping has created a data crisis, while existing solutions require weeks of manual negotiation.

Opendatabay makes AI-ready datasets instantly discoverable, legally compliant, and immediately usable.

## How It Works

### For Data Buyers (AI Developers, LLM teams, Enterprise buyers)

**1. Discover**

* Search on the platform or ask any LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.)
* All datasets are automatically exposed to major LLMs and search engines
* Get AI-powered recommendations with accuracy scores

**2. Evaluate**

* Review quality scores, provenance, and use cases
* Check licensing terms (General or Commercial AI License)
* Compare pricing and delivery methods

**3. Purchase & Access**

* Instant download or API access
* AI-ready formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet)
* Clear licensing for training, fine-tuning, commercial use

**4. Train Models**

* Pre-processed datasets save 20-40% preprocessing time
* Ready for immediate model training
* No legal risk from unlicensed data

***

### For Data Providers (Sellers)

**1. List Dataset**

* Upload data and add its description
* Set pricing and license type
* Platform verifies and processes

**2. Automatic Exposure**

* Instantly discoverable by all major LLMs
