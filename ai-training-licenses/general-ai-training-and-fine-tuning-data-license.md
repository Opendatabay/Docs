### **2. License Grant and Scope (Permitted Uses)**

#### 2.1 License Grant
The Licensor grants the Licensee a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual (subject to termination rights in Section 10) right to use this Data Product **solely for internal research, evaluation, and educational purposes**.

The Licensee may:
- Train or fine-tune models, including LLMs and AI agents, AI applications and systems **for internal use only**.
- Create and use model outputs, embeddings, weights, or other Derivative Works **strictly for non-commercial purposes**.
- Evaluate models and publish research or benchmarks **without redistributing the Data Product**.

**Commercial deployment, use in production API services, or any form of monetisation is NOT permitted.**

#### 2.2 Licensor Representations
The Licensor represents and warrants that:
- It has the rights and authority necessary to license the Data Product for the Permitted Uses.
- The Data Product was collected and provided in compliance with applicable data protection and related laws (including, where applicable, GDPR, EU AI Act and similar regimes).
- The Licensor has used commercial best practices and reasonable technical measures to filter and exclude personal data/PII or special category sensitive data from the Data Product.
- The Licensor is not aware of any malware, viruses, or malicious code in the Data Product.
- The Data Product has been prepared with reasonable care and professional standards for AI training purposes.
- To the best of Licensor’s knowledge, the Data Product has not been intentionally altered to include ‘poisoned’ samples, trigger phrases, or adversarial inputs designed to compromise the alignment or security of resulting Models.

The Licensor does not warrant that the Data Product is free from all third-party claims, nor that Licensee’s specific use of the Data Product, Models, or Derivative Works will be lawful in all jurisdictions or for all intended use cases. The Licensor does not guarantee specific model performance or outcomes.

### **3. Restrictions (Prohibited Uses)**
This license covers internal research, evaluation, and educational use only.

#### 3.1 Prohibited Activities
Licensee may not:
- **Use the Data Product, Models, or Derivative Works for any commercial purposes, monetisation, or deployment in external-facing AI services.**
- Resell, redistribute, or sublicense the Data Product itself.
- Intentionally remove, obscure, or alter any digital watermarks, cryptographic signatures, or provenance metadata embedded within the Data Product. These markers are essential for verifying ethical sourcing and supply chain integrity.
- Use the Data Product in ways that violate applicable laws or regulations, including discrimination, unlawful surveillance, or other prohibited applications.

#### 3.2 Separate Licensing for Commercial Use
For uses involving commercial deployment, monetisation, or external distribution of Models, **Licensee must obtain a Commercial Use License** from the Licensor.

### **4. Models, Derivatives, and Redistribution Rights**

#### 4.1 Rights Granted
Licensee may create Models using the Data Product, including training, fine-tuning, or evaluating AI, ML, LLMs, and agentic AI systems. Licensee is granted a non-exclusive, worldwide, and perpetual right to:
- Use Model outputs (predictions, text, audio, embeddings, images, or other results) **for internal research or educational purposes only**.
- Create and use Derivative Works such as fine-tuned weights, embeddings, or model variants **for internal purposes**.
- Evaluate Models and publish benchmarks or performance results, provided that the Data Product itself is not disclosed.

#### 4.2 Restrictions on Data Product Redistribution
Licensee may not redistribute or sublicense the original Data Product itself.

#### 4.3 Sharing of Models and Derivative Works
Licensee may share Models and Derivative Works **only within the Licensee’s organisation** for research or educational purposes. External distribution is prohibited unless the underlying Data Product is not exposed and the distribution is strictly non-commercial (e.g., academic collaboration).

**Safe Harbor for Model Outputs:** The inadvertent, non-systematic reproduction of insignificant portions of the Data Product by a Model (e.g., through overfitting or stochastic generation) shall not constitute a breach of this Section, provided that the Licensee has not intentionally engineered the Model to act as a database or substitute for the Data Product.

#### 4.4 Responsibilities and Liability
Licensee is responsible for its own use of Models and Derivative Works. While Licensee may release Derivative Works (such as Model Weights) for non-commercial research, Licensee acknowledges they are solely responsible for implementing ‘defence-in-depth’ safeguards and ensuring such releases comply with applicable Frontier AI Safety Frameworks.

### **5. Compliance Obligations**
