# AI Licensing Overview and Differences between General and Comercial Licenses 


## Why AI Training Licenses Matter

Traditional data licenses were designed for analytics, reporting, and business intelligence, not for training artificial intelligence models. AI training creates unique legal challenges that standard data licenses don't address.

### For Data Sellers

**AI training licenses protect you from:**

- Unauthorised model training and fine-tuning on your data
- Loss of control over how AI models use your datasets
- Unclear terms around model outputs and derivative works
- Missing revenue opportunities from AI-specific use cases
- Compliance gaps with EU AI Act and emerging AI regulations

### For Data Buyers

**AI training licenses give you clarity on:**

- What you can actually do with trained models and outputs
- Whether you can commercialise AI products built on the data
- Rights to distribute model weights and embeddings
- Your obligations under AI safety and transparency regulations
- Protection from liability for downstream model behavior

## The Problem with Standard Data Licenses

Traditional data licenses don't cover:

- **Model ownership**: Who owns the trained AI model?
- **Derivative works**: Can you share fine-tuned weights or embeddings?
- **Reconstruction risks**: What if the model memorises training data?
- **AI-specific compliance**: EU AI Act transparency, export controls for AI models
- **Downstream liability**: Who's responsible when open-weight models are misused?

**Result**: Legal uncertainty that slows innovation and creates risk for both parties.

## Opendatabay's Two AI Licenses

Opendatabay provides **two specialised AI training licenses** designed to meet different needs while ensuring fairness and legal compliance.

### General AI Training and Fine-Tuning Data License

**Best for**: Academic research, non-commercial projects, experimentation, and open-source model development.

**Key Features:**

- Non-commercial use only
- Training, fine-tuning, and evaluation rights
- Can publish research and benchmarks
- Lower cost or free tier access
- Educational and research-friendly terms

**Ideal Users:**

- Academic researchers and universities
- Open-source AI communities
- Students and educators
- Non-profit organisations

### Commercial AI Training and Fine-Tuning Data License

**Best for**: Commercial AI products, SaaS platforms, enterprise deployments, and revenue-generating models.

**Key Features:**

- Full commercial rights for models and outputs
- Sublicensing rights for AI services
- Can distribute model weights commercially
- Clear liability protections for downstream use
- EU AI Act and export control compliance built-in

**Ideal Users:**

- AI startups and scaleups
- Enterprise AI teams
- LLM developers and fine-tuners
- Commercial AI service providers

## Key Differences at a Glance

| Feature | General License | Commercial License |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Commercial Use** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Model Distribution** | Research only | ✅ Unlimited |
| **AI Services/APIs** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Sublicensing** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Use Case** | Research & Learning, POC | Production & Revenue |

## What Both Licenses Cover

Both Opendatabay AI licenses provide:

✅ **Clear training rights** for ML, LLMs, and agentic AI systems  
✅ **Model ownership** clarity for licensees  
✅ **Data protection** for licensors against redistribution  
✅ **EU AI Act compliance** requirements and guidance  
✅ **Export control** provisions for AI models  
✅ **Fair liability limits** for both parties  
✅ **Data deletion** and retention rules  
✅ **Audit rights** to verify compliance  

## Choosing the Right License

### Choose **General License** if you:

- Are conducting academic or non-commercial research
- Want to experiment with models before committing to commercial use
- Are building open-source projects without revenue plans
- Need lower-cost access for educational purposes

### Choose **Commercial License** if you:

- Plan to sell AI products, services, or API access
- Want to commercialise trained models or model weights
- Need to sublicense AI capabilities to customers
- Are building production AI systems for enterprise use
- Require full legal protection for commercial deployment

**Questions about which license is right for you?** Review the full license terms in the documentation or contact the data provider directly through the Opendatabay platform.
